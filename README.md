# Password Management
This project aims to implement a python application capable of managing users' passwords. In this regard, the user's passwords are encrypted with their own defined MasterKey, which comprises a hash function, the user's password, and username. Moreover, the `AES` encryption algorithm is used to encrypt and decrypt passwords. Here are some sections of the program that the user might encounter:

> * logout
> * login
>   - Go to home
>   - Save your passwords
>   - Change your passwords
>     - Go to user account
>     - Change login password
>     - Change password of a website    
> * register

**NOTE:** In this project I tried to implement algorithms as much as possible. For instance, the `AES` encryption algorithm is implemented from scratch.
